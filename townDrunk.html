    <p>You have a hunch that it is the town's drunk who stole the old woman's silver and heirlooms. The bastard has been stealing from the town's folk to pay for his ale. At least he has the decency to pay for the ale. </p>
    <p>You approach the drunk bastard, and demand the silver he stole from the poor helpless old woman. "So ye like to steal from old woman, ye drunk bastard! Give me the silver!!</p>
    <p>The drunk bastard laughs sinicly in yer face. </p>
    <p>You'll teach him a lesson. You stab him with yer sword out of anger, and you kill the bastard.</p>
    <p>The people in the tavern, see nothing but that you have stabbed an inncocent drunk man. You are seized and arrested for your crimes. A trial is held, and you are burned at the stake alive. To hells flames you'll go! </p>
    <p>The End!</p>
