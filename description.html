    <h2>You decide to ask the old woman for a description of the theives.</h2>

    <p>
      "Of course I'll help you, faire maiden! May you describe what the thieves
      looked like?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The old woman replies, "Hmmm... I do not recall, I heard a loud noise in
      the middle of the night but it was my cat, JellyBean, who knocked
      something over in my kitchen. The noise startled me." The old woman goes
      on to recant her entire day. You have been listening to her talk about her
      day for 15 hours before she recalls that she had moved her heirlooms and
      silver to a different cupboard in case theives ever robbed her.

    <p>
      "Oh how foolish of me, I forgot that I had moved my valuables in the
      unfortunate event that theives ever came looking for them. My apologies,
      my dear Knight."
    </p>

    <p>
      You reply, "No worries faire maiden, this sort of thing happens all of the
      time. Good day to you!"

    <p>
      The old woman thanks you for your time. Alas' you are off again on your
      mission to save the princess. When you get back to town, you hear the
      godawful news that you are too late! You wasted all of your time talking
      to the old woman, and getting a description of the so-called thieves,
      while the princess was gruesomely eaten alive by an Ogre.

    <p>
      You have failed your mission and are a mockery to the Knightly
      brotherhood. How dare thee call thyself a Knight!
